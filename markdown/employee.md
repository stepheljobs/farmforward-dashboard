Creating a new model in a web application typically involves several steps, including defining the model, creating a database migration, and setting up the controller and views. Here's a plan to guide you through the process of creating an `Employee` model using the provided information:

### 1. Define the Model

- **Model Name**: `Employee`
- **Attributes**:
  - `name`: String
  - `employee_id`: Integer
  - `position`: String
  - `email`: String
  - `phone_number`: String
  - `address`: String
  - `employment_status`: String

### 2. Create the Migration

- **Migration File**: Create a migration file to define the `employees` table with the following columns:
  - `name`: String
  - `employee_id`: Integer (unique)
  - `position`: String
  - `email`: String (unique)
  - `phone_number`: String
  - `address`: String
  - `employment_status`: String

### 3. Set Up the Controller

- **Controller Name**: `EmployeesController`
- **Actions**:
  - `index`: List all employees
  - `show`: Display a single employee
  - `new`: Form to create a new employee
  - `create`: Save a new employee
  - `edit`: Form to edit an existing employee
  - `update`: Update an existing employee
  - `destroy`: Delete an employee

### 4. Create the Views

- **Views for Employees**:
  - `index.html`: Display a list of all employees
  - `show.html`: Display details of a single employee
  - `new.html`: Form to create a new employee
  - `edit.html`: Form to edit an existing employee

### 5. Routes

- Define routes for the `EmployeesController` to handle the standard RESTful actions.

### 6. Validation and Testing

- **Validation**: Add validations in the `Employee` model to ensure data integrity (e.g., presence of required fields, uniqueness of `employee_id` and `email`).
- **Testing**: Write tests for the model, controller, and views to ensure everything works as expected.

### 7. Deployment

- Once everything is set up and tested locally, deploy the changes to your production environment.

This plan provides a structured approach to creating the `Employee` model and its associated components in a typical web application framework. If you need help with any specific step, feel free to ask!
